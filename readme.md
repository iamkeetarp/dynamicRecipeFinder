### Introduction

Welcome to the Recipe Finder project! This web application allows users to search for recipes using a search box that queries an API. The search results are displayed in cards, and users can click on a card to view more details about a specific recipe in a modal.

### Features

1. Search Box: Users can enter a term in the search box to find recipes.

2. Recipe Cards: Search results are presented as cards, each containing essential information about a recipe, such as its name, image, and a brief description.

3. Modal View: Clicking on a recipe card opens a modal that provides detailed information about the selected recipe, including ingredients and instructions.
